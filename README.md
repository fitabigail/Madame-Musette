> ## Aim of the website
---
</br>
Madame Musette is a website for selling ladies shoes. The user can quickly search for a specific shoe categories, through the search bar on home page, or by more specific fields on the cars page. Also, the user can navigate on shoes, and choose a shoe post to have more details about.  </br></br>


> ## User Experience or User Interface
---
</br>

### Agile
The plan for this project was carried out using the Agile Methodology in Github. User Stories were created using the issues on the git hub. Each user story explicitly explains the purpose of the issues. Each user story is segmented into acceptance criteria and tasks. It was prioritised using GitHub labels with different colors. The labels are should have, could have, must have and duplicate. Once the issues are created they are moved to the User Stories kanban board. The Kanban board has three main columns, To Do, In Progress and Done. Once you start working with the user story, you move it to the To Do column and when finished move it to the Done column. Following this pattern of work gives you a full-on idea about the progress of the project.</br></br>
